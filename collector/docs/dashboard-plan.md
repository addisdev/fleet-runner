# Fleet Runner — Dashboard Plan

*Companion to `fleet-runner-plan.html`, which lives beside the repo checkouts and
covers all four components. This document is collector-only, so it lives here.
Written 2026-08-18.*

> **Status — complete, including the runner-side follow-up.** D0 through D6 are
> built and merged (2026-08-19), and `vision-eval` now reports accuracy and
> latency under their own names on both runners, so the plant-ID report is
> reproducible from a query.
>
> **D0–D6** were merged
> across [PR #1](https://github.com/addisdev/collector/pull/1) (D0–D2) and
> [PR #2](https://github.com/addisdev/collector/pull/2) (D3–D6). The smoke
> suite grew from 44 to **207 checks** and survives repeated runs against one
> collector.
>
> **Original status note, D0–D2:** The read API, SSE stream, and
> Preact SPA ship in `fleet-collector`: `src/api/` (overview, devices, jobs,
> results, system, stream), `src/dash-static.ts`, and `dash/` for the UI. The
> old server-rendered dashboard moved to `/dash/legacy`. The smoke suite grew to
> 123 checks covering the API, the stream, and path traversal on the static
> route, and passes end to end.
>
> Real screens: **Overview, Devices (list + detail), Jobs (list + detail),
> Schedules (read-only), System.** Filters live in the URL. Device detail charts
> 24 h of battery and thermal from the beacon stream, breaking the line across
> gaps rather than drawing a segment no measurement supports. Results, Artifacts
> and Events remain stubs linking their live endpoints.
>
> **D2 adds control:** a job composer with a live "N devices match" preview that
> uses the same matcher fan-out uses, cancel / retry / priority, saved job
> templates, and device name / notes / pool editing. Cancelling is its own
> status, never `failed` — a person stopping a job is not a breakage, and the
> failure counts and alerts depend on that distinction. Pool edits live in a
> separate `pools_override` column because the runner rewrites `pools` on every
> registration. Mutations sit behind an optional `FLEET_DASH_TOKEN`.
>
> The `cancelled` status needed a CHECK-constraint widening, which SQLite only
> allows via table rebuild; that migration was tested against a hand-built
> pre-D2 database with data in it, and preserves rows, `last_error`, and indexes.
>
> **Legacy is not deletable yet** — one gap remains: the cross-device benchmark
> comparison at `/dash/legacy/bench`, which needs D3's trend charts.
> Details in [`README.md`](../README.md#dashboard).

## 0. Where we are

The collector already ships a dashboard: `GET /dash` in `collector/src/dash.ts` renders five static tables (devices, last 50 jobs, last 50 results, schedules, locks) and `GET /dash/bench` renders the cross-device benchmark table. It is read-only, has no filtering, no detail pages, no charts, no actions, and refreshes only on reload. Everything you can *do* to the fleet today is a `curl` against the JSON API.

The API underneath is in better shape than the UI: jobs with leases/attempts/`last_error`, fan-out, schedules, device locks, artifacts, events, power webhooks, status reports. So the dashboard is mostly a **read + control surface over data that already exists**, plus a handful of missing endpoints.

## 1. Goals

1. **See the fleet at a glance** — which devices are online, busy, charging, hot; what's queued/running/failed; whether the scheduler and collector are healthy.
2. **Manage jobs without curl** — inspect, enqueue (from templates), cancel, retry, re-run on a different pool, and follow a job's attempts and per-device results.
3. **Read results as results, not rows** — benchmark trends, UI-test pass/fail matrices, drain curves, soak survival timelines, with the honest-numbers rules baked in.
4. **Operate the collector** — schedules on/off, artifacts, power, sweeps, CI arming status, log/DB health.
5. **Get told when something breaks** — device offline, job failed, thermal critical, schedule missed.

Non-goals: auth/multi-tenant (stays LAN/Tailscale-only), editing job specs by hand in a text box as the *primary* path, anything that requires the phone apps to change protocol.

## 2. Architecture

```
collector/
  src/server.ts        ← existing routes  +  new /api/* JSON routes  +  SSE stream
  src/dash.ts          ← keep as /dash/legacy until the new UI covers it, then delete
  src/api/             ← new: jobs.ts, devices.ts, results.ts, system.ts, stream.ts
  dash/                ← new: Vite + Preact + TypeScript SPA
    src/pages/…        ← Overview, Devices, Jobs, Results, Schedules, Artifacts, System
    dist/              ← built assets, served by @fastify/static at /dash
```

**Decisions**

- **Same process, same SQLite.** The dashboard is served by the collector, not a second service. One thing to keep alive under launchd, one URL (`http://fleet-host.local:8788/dash`), no CORS. Reads go through prepared statements with hard `LIMIT`s; SQLite WAL means dashboard reads never block device long-polls.
- **JSON API first, UI second.** Every screen is backed by a `/api/*` endpoint that `curl` and future scripts can use. The old server-rendered `/dash` moves to `/dash/legacy` on day one and is removed once parity is reached.
- **Preact + Vite, no framework beyond that.** Small bundle (the collector host is a 2016 MacBook and the dashboard will be opened on phones on the shelf), TypeScript shared with the collector for the job/result types, `uPlot` for charts (≈40 KB, handles thousands of beacon points). Dark mode via `prefers-color-scheme` like today.
- **Live updates over SSE, not WebSockets.** `GET /api/stream` pushes `{type: "job"|"device"|"result"|"beacon", …}` events. The collector already has single write paths for each table (`POST /results`, `/jobs`, `/devices/register`, sweep, scheduler) — emit from those; no polling loop and no external broker (matches the events-rails philosophy).
- **No auth, but a mutation guard.** Reads are open. Mutating actions (cancel, retry, enable schedule, power off) require an `X-Fleet-Token` header if `FLEET_DASH_TOKEN` is set, and always a confirm dialog in the UI. Default unset = today's behavior.

## 3. Screens

### 3.1 Overview (`/dash`)
The "is the fleet OK" page. Fits on one phone screen.

- **Fleet strip:** devices online / stale / offline (derived from `last_seen` vs the 60 s beacon: online <3 min, stale <15 min, offline beyond), busy vs idle, how many charging, worst thermal state.
- **Queue strip:** queued / claimed / done-24h / failed-24h, oldest queued job age, jobs on their last attempt.
- **Running now:** each claimed job with device, workload, elapsed, lease remaining as a shrinking bar, latest beacon.
- **Recent failures:** last 10 failed jobs with `last_error` inline.
- **Scheduler:** enabled schedules with next-fire countdown; red if a schedule's `last_run` is more than one interval late.
- **Collector health:** uptime, sweep last ran, DB size, artifact store size, log file size (the README warns launchd doesn't rotate it), CI armed/unarmed badge.

### 3.2 Devices (`/dash/devices`, `/dash/devices/:id`)
- Table/grid with filter by platform, OS, pool, status; sort by last seen, battery, thermal. Columns: name, model · SoC · RAM, OS, pools, battery + charging icon, thermal, current job, lock holder, last seen.
- **Detail page:** full descriptor JSON, pools (editable), free-text notes ("USB hub port 3", "screen cracked"), 24 h battery + thermal chart from `beacon_samples`, job history for this device, latest benchmark numbers, actions: **run job on this device** (opens composer pinned to it), **release lock**, **power on/off** (its pool's webhook), **forget device** (delete registry row).
- Cross-platform care: memory always shown with `mem_method`; iOS simulators flagged so they are never mistaken for hardware.

### 3.3 Jobs (`/dash/jobs`, `/dash/jobs/:id`)
- Paginated list with filters: status, workload, executor, pool, device, date range, "has error", free-text over `job_id`. Saved filters in the URL so links are shareable.
- Row: job_id, workload, executor, status pill, claimed_by, attempts `n/max`, lease countdown, created/finished, duration.
- **Detail page:** spec JSON (pretty, collapsible), attempts timeline (claimed → beacons → swept/requeued → done/failed), per-device results table, artifacts produced (JUnit XML, screenshots, batch outputs — inline viewer for images/XML), `last_error`, status report row if `report_to` was set, and — for fan-out parents — the child job matrix.
- **Actions:** cancel (queued → `cancelled`; claimed → mark cancelled and the runner sees `lease_renewed:false` on its next beacon), retry (clone spec to a new `job_id` with a `-r2` suffix, optionally onto a different pool/device), re-run fan-out, bump priority, force sweep.
- **Job composer** (`/dash/jobs/new`): form generated from `schemas/job.schema.json` with a workload picker that pre-fills sensible params per workload (benchmark, batch, pipeline, install, ui-test, drain, soak, vision-eval). Pick target by pool / `match` expression / pinned device with a live "N devices match" preview. Pick model/app from the artifact store or upload. Toggle fan-out. Shows the equivalent `curl` before submit so nothing is hidden. Templates can be saved and become the basis for schedules.

### 3.4 Results
- **Benchmarks** (`/dash/results/bench`): today's table, plus per-config **trend chart** (decode tok/s per device over time) so a regression after an app or model change is visible, a **device comparison** bar chart per model/quant, and a **sustained-load** view (tok/s vs thermal state over the run). Rules from the plan enforced in the UI: prefill and decode never merged, `mem_method` never mixed on one axis, simulator rows greyed and excluded from comparisons by default.
- **UI tests** (`/dash/results/ui`): build × device pass/fail matrix from JUnit artifacts, click-through to failing test names, screenshots/video, flaky detection (same test alternating over the last N runs).
- **Drain** (`/dash/results/drain`): battery % vs time per run, overlay multiple runs (app version A vs B, device vs device), slope in %/h.
- **Soak** (`/dash/results/soak`): process-alive timeline per device per night, the OEM-killer survival matrix.
- **Vision eval**: top-1/top-5 + p50/p95 per model per device (the GreenFolio eval), so the next eval is a page rather than a one-off report.
- **Export**: every result view has CSV/JSON download of the underlying rows.

### 3.5 Schedules (`/dash/schedules`)
List with cron (human-readable "every day at 02:00"), enabled toggle, last run, next run, the template summarized, and history of the jobs it fired. Actions: enable/disable, run now (`POST /schedules/tick` scoped to one id), edit template via the composer, delete.

### 3.6 Artifacts (`/dash/artifacts`)
Name, kind (model / apk / app zip / junit / screenshot / batch output — inferred from name and referencing job), size, sha256 (copy button), created, referenced-by jobs. Upload from the browser (streaming — this is the trigger to fix the in-memory upload buffer noted in Phase 0). **GC**: list unreferenced artifacts older than N days and delete on confirm.

### 3.7 Events / pipeline (`/dash/events`)
Topics with event count and last-event time, tail of recent payloads, per-topic throughput. Useful for watching a tiered pipeline actually flow.

### 3.8 System (`/dash/system`)
Power controls per pool (on/off webhook + last invocation result), sweep now, scheduler tick now, CI arming status and the `status_reports` audit trail, DB stats per table, retention controls (beacon_samples/events older than N days), tail of `~/Library/Logs/fleet-collector.log`, collector version + node version + uptime.

### 3.9 Alerts
Rules evaluated in the collector on a 60 s tick (piggyback on the sweep loop):

| Rule | Default |
|---|---|
| Device offline (no beacon) | > 15 min |
| Job failed (final attempt) | always |
| Job stuck: claimed with lease renewed but no result rows | > 2× expected duration |
| Thermal `critical` on any device | always |
| Battery < 15 % and not charging | always |
| Schedule missed (enabled, due, not fired) | > 5 min late |
| Collector disk / log size | > thresholds |

Delivered to: the dashboard (banner + `/dash/alerts` history), and optionally an ntfy/webhook URL and macOS notification on the host. Alerts have ack/snooze so a known-dead device doesn't nag.

## 4. API additions

New or extended endpoints, all JSON:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/overview` | Everything the Overview page needs in one call |
| `GET /api/devices`, `GET /api/devices/:id`, `PATCH /api/devices/:id`, `DELETE /api/devices/:id` | List/detail/edit pools+name+notes/forget |
| `GET /api/devices/:id/beacons?since=` | Beacon history for charts |
| `GET /api/jobs?status=&workload=&executor=&pool=&device=&q=&from=&to=&page=` | Filtered, paginated list |
| `GET /api/jobs/:id` (extends existing) | Adds results, artifacts, children, attempts timeline |
| `POST /api/jobs/:id/cancel`, `POST /api/jobs/:id/retry`, `PATCH /api/jobs/:id` (priority) | Job actions |
| `POST /api/jobs/preview-targets` | "N devices match this target" for the composer |
| `GET /api/results?job=&device=&workload=&from=&to=` + `/api/results/bench|ui|drain|soak` | Result views, shaped for charts |
| `GET /api/schedules/:id/history`, `POST /api/schedules/:id/run` | Schedule detail |
| `GET /api/artifacts`, `DELETE /api/artifacts/:sha256`, `GET /api/artifacts/gc-candidates` | Artifact management |
| `GET /api/events` (topics), `GET /api/events/:topic?limit=` | Event browsing |
| `GET /api/health`, `GET /api/system` | Uptime, DB/artifact/log sizes, CI armed |
| `GET /api/alerts`, `POST /api/alerts/:id/ack` | Alert history |
| `GET /api/stream` | SSE |

Schema changes (all additive, following the existing `ALTER TABLE` pattern in `db.ts`):
- `jobs`: `priority INTEGER DEFAULT 0` (claim order becomes priority DESC, created_at ASC), `parent_job_id TEXT` (fan-out children), `cancelled` added to the status CHECK, `template_id TEXT`.
- `devices`: `name TEXT`, `notes TEXT`.
- `results`: index on `(device_id, created_at)`.
- new `alerts` table, new `job_templates` table.

## 5. Build phases

Each phase is shippable and leaves `/dash` working.

| Phase | Scope | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| **D0 — API + skeleton** ✅ **built** | `/api/*` read endpoints, SSE stream, Vite/Preact scaffold served at `/dash`, old dash at `/dash/legacy`, smoke tests for new endpoints | `curl /api/overview` returns the fleet; empty SPA loads over the LAN |
| **D1 — Overview + Devices + Jobs (read)** ✅ **built** | Screens 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 minus actions; live via SSE; filters in URL. Read-only Schedules added to close a legacy gap | Legacy dash can be deleted — *all but `/dash/legacy/bench`, which waits on D3* |
| **D2 — Job control** ✅ **built** | Cancel/retry/priority, composer with templates + target preview, device pools/notes editing, mutation token | A benchmark fan-out and a Maestro run can be launched and followed entirely from the browser |
| **D3 — Results** ✅ **built** | Bench trends + comparison, UI-test matrix + artifact viewer, drain curves, soak timeline, vision-eval page, CSV export | Next GreenFolio eval needs no hand-built report |
| **D4 — Operations** ✅ **built** | Schedules UI, artifacts (streaming upload + GC), events, system page, power controls | Nightly schedules can be enabled and monitored from the dashboard |
| **D5 — Alerts** ✅ **built** | Rule engine on the sweep tick, dashboard banner/history, ntfy/webhook, ack/snooze | A device pulled off the shelf shows up in the phone's notifications inside 15 min |
| **D6 — Polish** ✅ **built** | Phone layout pass, keyboard shortcuts (`g j` jobs, `/` search), retention jobs, docs | README "Endpoints" table updated; `fleet-runner-plan.html` status block updated |

## 6. Testing

- Extend `scripts/smoke.ts` with the `/api/*` endpoints (against a throwaway collector, per the README rule — never the live one).
- Unit tests for derived state: online/stale/offline thresholds, next-fire computation, alert rules, target preview.
- One Playwright flow: enqueue via composer → job appears in list → SSE update flips it to done when the smoke runner reports.
- Full smoke suite before every deploy to fleet-host (per your global testing rule).

## 7. Risks and mitigations

- **Beacon table growth** — 60 s beacons × N devices is ~1.4 k rows/device/day; charts query by index but the table needs retention. Add a nightly retention step (default 30 days raw; keep hourly rollups longer) in D4.
- **Dashboard load on the collector** — the host is a 2016 MacBook serving long-polls. Keep every dashboard query bounded, cache `/api/overview` for 2 s, and never compute charts server-side over unbounded ranges.
- **Cancelling a claimed job** — relies on the runner honoring `lease_renewed:false` on its next beacon; the Android/iOS agents already do this for swept leases, so cancel reuses that path rather than a new protocol message.
- **No auth on a mutation surface** — mitigated by LAN/Tailscale-only + optional token + confirm dialogs; explicitly not building login.
- **Artifact upload buffering** — streaming upload from the browser is the forcing function for the Phase-0 note about in-memory buffering; do it in D4, don't defer again.

## 8. Done — the runner apps now emit the named fields

**Landed 2026-08-19.** `vision-eval` results no longer arrive in metric fields
that mean something else, so the plant-ID report is reproducible from a query.

- [`fleet-runner-android#1`](https://github.com/addisdev/runner-android/pull/1)
- [`fleet-runner-ios#1`](https://github.com/addisdev/runner-ios/pull/1)
- [`fleet-collector#3`](https://github.com/addisdev/collector/pull/3) — the drain half

### What was wrong

A `vision-eval` run is a `batch` job on a `litert` (Android) or `coreml` (iOS)
backend. With no fields of its own it borrowed the LLM ones:

| Was written as | Actually held | Now |
|---|---|---|
| `metrics.decode_tok_s` | top-1 accuracy, percent | `metrics.top1_pct` |
| `metrics.ttft_ms` | median per-image latency | `metrics.p50_ms` |
| `metrics.prefill_tok_s` | images per second | `metrics.images_per_s` |
| — | top-5 computed, then discarded | `metrics.top5_pct` |
| — | p95 computed, then discarded | `metrics.p95_ms` |

Both runners computed top-5 and p95 correctly and wrote them into the uploaded
report artifact — the results table simply had nowhere to put them. That is why
the published report carried numbers no query could reproduce.

The comment justifying the overload, in both runners and in the host executor's
drain path, said the slots were reused "so the bench page can chart it".
**That was never true.** Both bench queries filter `workload = 'benchmark'`, and
these are `batch` and `drain` jobs. The overload bought nothing.

### One correction to an earlier version of this document

This section previously said the iOS runner "does not actually compute
accuracy". That was wrong. It always did — but it wrote
`(report["top1_acc"] as? Double ?? 0) * 100`, defaulting a missing value to
**zero**, which in storage cannot be told apart from a run that genuinely scored
nothing. That is how historical Core ML rows came to read 0.0% for runs that
really scored 75.8%. The default is gone: a run that cannot compute accuracy now
sends no field, and the dashboard shows unknown.

### Verified end to end

Not just compiled. The int8 Core ML model and the real 120-image eval set, run
on an iPhone 17 Pro simulator against a collector:

```
top1_pct 75.83   top5_pct 90.83   p50_ms 11.67   p95_ms 19.99   images_per_s 85.67
```

The published report says **75.8% / 90.8%** for that model — reproduced exactly,
with top-5 and p95 in the results table for the first time and no LLM fields on
the row. The dashboard reads it `inferred: false`, while the pre-fix run of the
same model still shows `top1: 0.0, top5: null, inferred: true` — historical rows
keep rendering, correctly labelled.

Android carries the same change with a protocol test pinning the wire format;
its hardware run needs a device on the shelf.

## 9. What the build changed about the plan

Three things the plan did not anticipate, all settled in code:

- **Vision-eval and drain metrics had no fields.** They were smuggled through
  the LLM slots — vision put top-1 accuracy in `decode_tok_s`, p50 latency in
  `ttft_ms`, throughput in `prefill_tok_s`; drain put percent-per-hour in
  `decode_tok_s` — and top-5 and p95 were never stored at all. That is why the
  published plant-ID report carries numbers no query can reproduce.
  `result.schema.json` now names them, and the views mark anything inferred.
  **D3's aim — that the next eval needs no hand-written report — is therefore
  not met yet.** It needs the runner apps to emit the named fields, and those
  live in the runner repos.
- **`/dash/legacy` is kept, not deleted.** The plan had it retired at parity. It
  has no unique feature left, but it is the only dashboard with no build step,
  which is exactly what a bare checkout or a broken bundle needs.
- **Pool edits needed their own column.** The runner rewrites `pools` on every
  registration, so an operator edit sharing that column would vanish within the
  minute. Effective pools are `pools_override ?? pools`, and the queue claims
  through the effective set.

## 10. Open questions (defaults chosen; say so if you disagree)

- **Preact SPA vs. htmx.** ✅ Preact. The finished bundle is 28 KB gzipped with
  no router, charting or static-file dependency — the results pages would indeed
  have fought htmx.
- **Where alerts are delivered.** ✅ ntfy-shaped `FLEET_ALERT_WEBHOOK` plus the
  dashboard banner. Unset by default, so the dashboard is the only channel until
  you point it somewhere.
- **Should the dashboard also cover the executor host?** ✅ Done in D4, and more
  cheaply than proposed: an executor already announces itself every 25 s by
  long-polling for work, so recording that poll needed no new endpoint and no
  change to `executor.ts` at all. Attached-USB inventory would still need one.
